            <h2><strong><i>Fun Facts </strong></i></h2>
        
            <ol>
                <li><p>During the party at Play's house, all of the dance sequences were done with no music. A.J. Johnson choreographed her and Tisha Campbell's routine for the battle. The toe-touch and kicks were actually signature moves for Kid-N-Play. They had become very popular as back up dancers for Salt-N-Pepa using these and more acrobatic stunts. The music was added after the dancing had been shot.</li></p>
                <li><p>
                    Full Force, an American music group of hip hop and R&B singers and producers from Brooklyn, New York, played the bullies in this movie.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>This movie happened to be released 9 days before legendary comedian Robin Harris passed away of a heart attack at just the age of 36 on March 18, 1990. House Party 2 which was released a year later in 1991, the film is dedicated to him</p></li>
                <li><p>House Party was originally written for DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, a.k.a. DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith. This happened because New Line Cinema won a lawsuit against them due to their song A Nightmare on My Street and one of the conditions were that they had to appear in a New Line film. Director Reginald Hudlin refused to cast them in the movie based on that term.</p></li>
                <li><p>House party is considered a cult classic, highlighting the "Golden Age of Hip-Hop" music when its culture was centered around parties, fun, and consensual affairs rather than the drugs, violence, and misogyny that came after its predominance in the early to mid-nineties.</p></li>
